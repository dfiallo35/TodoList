# TodoList

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). Uses [React](https://reactjs.org/) for the frontend and [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) for the backend.

It is a simple todo list application that allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed.

## Getting Started

First, create the Python enviroment and install the dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, install the Node.js dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Running the App

To run the app, you need to start the backend and the frontend simultaneously with the following command:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
